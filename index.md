## About me: 

I am a multiskilled professional with a background in Chemistry, Physics and Computer Science. I have 10+ years of quantitative research experience. I use my analytical and technical skills to solve academic and business data-oriented problems with innovative interdisciplinary approaches. Currently I am a [Research Data Librarian](https://www.library.cmu.edu/about/people/alfredo-gonzalez-espinoza) at Carnegie Mellon University, where I bring my interdisciplinary background and expertise in processing and analyzing data of various types to provide research and data management support to the whole CMU community.

Personally, I'm interested in tools and methods for statistical modelling and inference in social sciences and humanities. I am also interested in scientific research on diverse topics related to music, language, cognition, collective and human behavior from a complex systems perspective.

I am an amateur Cellist and usually spend my free time listening to music, playing video games and playing football (soccer).
